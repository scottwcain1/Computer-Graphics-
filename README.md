I approach software design by breaking down complex requirements into manageable components. This project helped me craft new design skills, such as applying realistic textures and experimenting with lighting to enhance lifelike qualities. Challenges like shaping a concave bowl tested my problem-solving abilities, and the iterative design process—planning, modeling, texturing, lighting, and refining—proved critical in overcoming obstacles and achieving a visually compelling scene.
In terms of program development, I focused on incremental improvements. Developing the bowl and the lighting setups involved exploring new strategies, like meticulous object adjustments and advanced lighting techniques. Iteration played a key role, allowing me to refine textures, object placement, and lighting step by step. Across milestones, my approach evolved as I gained confidence in troubleshooting and combining technical precision with creativity, resulting in a polished final product that reflects both artistic and technical growth.
This project has solidified my understanding of how computer science can help me reach my goals. Computational graphics and visualizations offer a bridge between creativity and technology, providing valuable skills for both educational and professional pursuits. These skills can enhance future coursework and projects. Professionally, they open pathways to working in industries like animation, game development, and product design, empowering me to create dynamic, visually impactful work that builds on the foundation of this project.
